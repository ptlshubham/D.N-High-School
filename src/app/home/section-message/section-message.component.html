                        in accordance with today's time, means D. N. High School Upper Primary School. A son of D. N.

                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Along with Education, I have extreme desire to do something special
                        by focusing on things like various sports activities, exercise and yoga for the health of my
                        children. Along with all my teachers and other staff members, I have cultivated a family spirit
                        and remained loyal to the institution and school. I am serving and will continue to serve the
                        administrative work. I have deep feeling in my heart that a student of my school will go to any
                        corner of the world will become proficient in any field. I am confident that my student will
                        swim differently in the field of education. I strongly believe in Work but not in Luck.
