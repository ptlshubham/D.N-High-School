                        Along with education, I have a desire to do something new by focusing on things like various
                        sports, exercise, yoga for the health of children. Along with all my teacher friends and other
                        staff and servant friends, I have cultivated a family spirit and remained loyal to the
                        institution and school, I am doing and will continue to do administrative work. I have a feeling
                        in my heart that a student of my school will go to any corner of the world, become proficient in
                        any field, make the name of the institution and school shine and in any field my student will
                        swim differently.
